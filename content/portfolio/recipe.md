### 👨‍🍳 Preparation

#### 1. Prep the potatoes
Place the potatoes in a large pot of water. Bring to a boil and cook on low heat for **15 minutes**.
*Tip: Do not fully cook them, they will finish cooking in the oven.*

#### 2. Cook the garnish
Meanwhile, roughly chop the onions. Sauté them in a frying pan over low heat with the olive oil until they are soft. In the same pan (or separately), cook the lardons until browned.

#### 3. Assembly
* Drain the potatoes, peel them, and cut them into rounds (slices).
* Preheat your oven to **200°C (400°F)**.
* Peel the garlic clove and rub it vigorously against the inside of your gratin dish (this adds a subtle flavor).

#### 4. Layering
In the gratin dish, create layers in the following order:
1.  A layer of potatoes
2.  A layer of onions
3.  A layer of lardons
4.  Another layer of potatoes

#### 5. The Cheese
Finish by placing the Reblochon cheese on top (crust side up usually implies crisper result, but follow your preference). Cut the pieces if necessary to ensure the cheese covers the whole dish.

#### 6. Baking
Bake for approximately **20 minutes** until the cheese is melted and golden brown.
