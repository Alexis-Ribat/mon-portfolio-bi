### 🛒 Ingredients

* **Potatoes:** At least 8 medium-sized
* **Onions:** 2 small
* **Cheese:** 2 half-slices of Reblochon (or 1 whole Reblochon cut horizontally)
* **Meat:** 1 package of lardons (bacon strips/cubes)

### 👨‍🍳 Preparation

#### 1. Prep the potatoes
Place the potatoes in a large pot of water. Bring to a boil and cook on low heat for **15 minutes**.
*Tip: Do not fully cook them, they will finish cooking in the oven.*

#### 2. Cook the garnish
Meanwhile, roughly chop the onions. Sauté them in a frying pan over low heat with the olive oil until they are soft. In the same pan (or separately), cook the lardons until browned.

#### 3. Assembly
* Drain the potatoes, peel them, and cut them into rounds (slices).
* Preheat your oven to **200°C (400°F)**.
* Peel the garlic clove and rub it vigorously against the inside of your gratin dish (this adds a subtle flavor).

#### 4. Layering
In the gratin dish, create layers in the following order:
1.  A layer of potatoes
2.  A layer of onions
3.  A layer of lardons
4.  Another layer of potatoes

#### 5. The Cheese
Finish by placing the Reblochon cheese on top (crust side up usually implies crisper result, but follow your preference). Cut the pieces if necessary to ensure the cheese covers the whole dish.

#### 6. Baking
Bake for approximately **20 minutes** until the cheese is melted and golden brown.

### 👨‍🍳 Preparation

#### 1. Prep the chicken
Cut the chicken breasts into strips (approx. **1 cm thick**).
Place them in a bowl and mix with the spices (paprika, cinnamon, chili), the minced garlic (or powder), salt, pepper, and a coating of cornstarch.

#### 2. Sear the meat
Heat some oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until slightly browned.
Add the chopped onion and cook for another **2 minutes**.

#### 3. The Glaze (Part 1)
Pour about **one-third** of the can of cola into the pan.
Let it simmer and reduce. Once reduced, pour in another third of the cola and let it reduce again.

#### 4. Thicken the sauce
In a small separate bowl, mix **1 tablespoon of cornstarch** with the remaining third of the cola.
Pour this mixture into the pan. The sauce will thicken instantly and coat the chicken beautifully.
